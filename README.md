### Who am I ?
My name is Saahil Thukral and I am working hard to become a machine learning engineer and data scientist. I am just starting out and I have started learning Python and R for this purpose. I am also planning to get into JULIA after learning both those languages. I will also begin my undergraduate program at the University of Toronto Scarborough.
